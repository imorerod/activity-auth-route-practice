Use Secure Submarine as your starting point for this exercise.

Create a server route that returns ALL registered users. Require that the user be logged in to access this data. You can either re-use one of the existing routers or create a new one.
Create a ProtectedRoute and new Component on the client that displays this information. You can make the axios request directly from the component (consider saga and reducer as stretch).
Add a navigation Link to the Nav component that brings the user to your new ProtectedRoute.
